# Adamize Requirements

## Overview

Adamize is a VS Code extension that provides AI-assisted development capabilities with a focus on test-driven development and DevOps best practices. The extension is designed to help developers write better code, follow best practices, and automate common development tasks.

## Core Requirements

### 1. MCP Client

The extension must include a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client that can:

- Connect to MCP servers
- Discover available tools
- Call functions on tools
- Handle responses and errors
- Validate parameters against function schemas
- Provide a user interface for interacting with MCP tools

### 2. Context Engine

The extension must include a context engine that can:

- Index and search code in the workspace
- Provide relevant code snippets based on the current context
- Support multiple programming languages
- Integrate with the MCP client to provide context to AI models

### 3. File Watcher

The extension must include a file watcher that can:

- Watch for file changes in the workspace
- Update the context engine when files change
- Ignore specified files and directories
- Debounce file change events to avoid excessive processing

### 4. Test Integration

The extension must include test integration that can:

- Run tests for the current file or project
- Generate test coverage reports
- Display test results in the VS Code interface
- Suggest test improvements based on coverage

### 5. DevOps Integration

The extension must include DevOps integration that can:

- Integrate with Git for version control
- Support GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Provide pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
- Generate documentation from code

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance

- The extension must not significantly impact VS Code performance
- The context engine must be able to handle large codebases
- The MCP client must be responsive and handle network latency

### 2. Security

- The extension must not expose sensitive information
- The MCP client must support secure connections
- The extension must not modify code without user consent

### 3. Usability

- The extension must provide clear and concise user interfaces
- The extension must provide helpful error messages
- The extension must be configurable through VS Code settings

### 4. Compatibility

- The extension must work with VS Code 1.80.0 and later
- The extension must support Windows, macOS, and Linux
- The extension must work with TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and other common languages

## Future Requirements

### 1. AI Code Generation

- Generate code based on natural language descriptions
- Suggest code improvements based on best practices
- Refactor code automatically

### 2. Documentation Generation

- Generate documentation from code comments
- Generate API documentation
- Generate user documentation

### 3. Code Review

- Provide automated code reviews
- Suggest improvements based on best practices
- Integrate with GitHub pull requests
