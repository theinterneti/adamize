# LLM Integration

This document outlines the approach for integrating local Large Language Models (LLMs) into the Adamize VS Code extension.

## Overview

Adamize plans to integrate with local LLMs through providers like Hugging Face and Ollama. This integration will enable AI-assisted development features while maintaining privacy and reducing dependency on cloud services.

## Architecture

The LLM integration architecture consists of several components:

1. **Model Manager**: Handles model discovery, downloading, and loading
2. **Context Engine**: Manages the context for LLM interactions
3. **Memory System**: Stores and retrieves development context
4. **Extension API**: Exposes LLM capabilities to the extension

### Model Manager

The Model Manager is responsible for:

- Discovering available local models
- Downloading models from remote sources
- Loading models for use in the extension
- Managing model versions and updates

See `src/utils/modelManager.ts` for implementation details.

### Context Engine

The Context Engine is responsible for:

- Building context from the current workspace
- Managing context window size
- Optimizing context for specific queries
- Handling context overflow

### Memory System

The Memory System is responsible for:

- Storing development context in a Neo4j database
- Retrieving relevant context for LLM interactions
- Managing long-term memory for the project
- Implementing forgetting mechanisms for outdated information

### Extension API

The Extension API exposes LLM capabilities to the extension through:

- Commands for interacting with LLMs
- Context menu items for specific actions
- Webview panels for complex interactions
- Status bar items for quick access

## Integration with LLM Providers

### Hugging Face

Integration with Hugging Face will use:

- Hugging Face Inference API for remote models
- Transformers.js for local models
- ONNX Runtime for optimized inference

Example usage:

```typescript
import { pipeline } from '@huggingface/inference';

const hf = new pipeline('text-generation', 'gpt2');
const result = await hf('Hello, I am a');
console.log(result);
```

### Ollama

Integration with Ollama will use:

- Ollama API for local models
- HTTP requests to the Ollama server

Example usage:

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:11434/api/generate', {
  model: 'llama2',
  prompt: 'Hello, I am a',
  stream: false
});

console.log(response.data.response);
```

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to interact with different LLM providers. The MCP client implementation in Adamize supports:

- Connecting to MCP servers
- Discovering available tools
- Calling functions on tools
- Handling responses and errors

## Implementation Plan

The LLM integration will be implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1: Basic Integration**
   - Implement Model Manager
   - Add support for Hugging Face and Ollama
   - Create basic LLM commands

2. **Phase 2: Context Engine**
   - Implement Context Engine
   - Add workspace context extraction
   - Optimize context for specific queries

3. **Phase 3: Memory System**
   - Implement Memory System
   - Add Neo4j integration
   - Create memory management commands

4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - Add code generation
   - Add code explanation
   - Add test generation
   - Add documentation generation

## Extension Points

The LLM integration will expose several extension points for customization:

1. **Model Providers**: Add support for additional LLM providers
2. **Context Extractors**: Customize how context is extracted from the workspace
3. **Memory Adapters**: Customize how memory is stored and retrieved
4. **Command Handlers**: Customize how LLM commands are handled

## Best Practices

When working with LLM integration:

1. **Privacy**: Ensure that user data is kept private
2. **Performance**: Optimize for performance, especially for large models
3. **Fallbacks**: Implement fallbacks for when models are not available
4. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and recovery options
5. **Documentation**: Document model capabilities and limitations

## Testing

Testing LLM integration requires:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test components working together
3. **Mock Models**: Use mock models for testing
4. **Benchmark Tests**: Measure performance of critical operations
