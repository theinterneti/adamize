# MCP Bridge Adaptation Summary

This document provides a summary of our plan to adapt the ollama-mcp-bridge code to work within the Adamize VS Code extension.

## Overview

We have created a detailed plan to adapt the ollama-mcp-bridge code to work within our VS Code extension. This adaptation will enable local LLM-powered agents to maintain and update a memory graph of project knowledge.

## Components

We have created detailed implementation plans for the following components:

1. **VS Code Logger** (`vscodeLogger.ts`): Replaces console-based logging with VS Code output channel
2. **Bridge Types** (`bridgeTypes.ts`): Defines types for the bridge components
3. **MCP Bridge Client** (`mcpBridgeClient.ts`): Handles communication with MCP servers
4. **LLM Client** (`llmClient.ts`): Handles communication with Ollama
5. **Tool Registry** (`toolRegistry.ts`): Manages tool registration and discovery
6. **MCP Bridge** (`mcpBridge.ts`): Core bridge component that manages tool registration and execution
7. **MCP Bridge Config Manager** (`mcpBridgeConfigManager.ts`): Manages bridge configuration
8. **MCP Bridge Manager** (`mcpBridgeManager.ts`): Manages bridge lifecycle and integration with VS Code
9. **MCP Bridge Commands** (`mcpBridgeCommands.ts`): Defines VS Code commands for interacting with the bridge

## Key Adaptations

The key adaptations we have made include:

1. **VS Code Integration**: Replaced console-based UI with VS Code UI, integrated with VS Code's command system, and added support for VS Code's progress API
2. **Configuration Management**: Used VS Code's configuration API instead of file-based config, added UI for configuration management, and supported multiple configuration profiles
3. **Process Management**: Adapted process spawning for VS Code, added support for multiple connection methods (HTTP, Docker exec, local process), and ensured proper error handling and recovery
4. **Tool Management**: Added support for VS Code commands as tools, integrated with VS Code's command system, and added support for tool categorization and filtering
5. **UI Integration**: Added status bar items, progress indicators, and notifications for bridge status and operations

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation approach follows these principles:

1. **Modularity**: Each component is designed to be modular and reusable
2. **Testability**: Each component has a detailed test plan
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery is built into each component
4. **VS Code Integration**: Deep integration with VS Code's UI and command system
5. **Configuration**: Flexible configuration options for all components

## Next Steps

The next steps in our adaptation plan are:

1. **Implement Core Components**: Implement the VS Code Logger, Bridge Types, MCP Bridge Client, and LLM Client
2. **Implement Bridge Components**: Implement the Tool Registry, MCP Bridge, and MCP Bridge Config Manager
3. **Implement VS Code Integration**: Implement the MCP Bridge Manager and MCP Bridge Commands
4. **Update Extension**: Update the extension to use the new MCP Bridge components
5. **Add Memory Graph Integration**: Extend the bridge to support memory graph operations
6. **Add UI Components**: Add UI for interacting with the bridge and memory graph
7. **Test and Refine**: Test all components and refine based on testing results

## Implementation Timeline

We will follow our TDD approach for the adaptation:

1. **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Implement VS Code Logger, Bridge Types, MCP Bridge Client, and LLM Client
2. **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Implement Tool Registry, MCP Bridge, and MCP Bridge Config Manager
3. **Phase 3 (Week 3)**: Implement MCP Bridge Manager and MCP Bridge Commands
4. **Phase 4 (Week 4)**: Update extension to use the new MCP Bridge components
5. **Phase 5 (Week 5)**: Add memory graph integration
6. **Phase 6 (Week 6)**: Add UI components
7. **Phase 7 (Week 7)**: Test and refine

## Conclusion

This adaptation plan provides a structured approach to integrating the ollama-mcp-bridge functionality into our VS Code extension. By following this plan, we will create a powerful extension that combines the capabilities of local LLMs with the MCP protocol, enabling advanced AI-assisted development with a focus on memory and context preservation.
