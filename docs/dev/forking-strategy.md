# Forking and Integration Strategy

This document outlines our approach to forking external repositories and integrating them into our project.

## Forking Process

### 1. Research and Evaluation

Before forking a repository, we should:
- Thoroughly research the repository's purpose, architecture, and components
- Evaluate how it aligns with our project goals
- Identify which components we need to extract or adapt
- Document our findings in the `docs/research` directory

### 2. Forking on GitHub

To fork a repository on GitHub:

1. Navigate to the repository you want to fork (e.g., https://github.com/patruff/ollama-mcp-bridge)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination for the fork
4. Wait for the forking process to complete

### 3. Cloning the Forked Repository

After forking, clone your fork to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

### 4. Adding the Upstream Remote

To keep your fork in sync with the original repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repository-name.git
```

### 5. Creating a Branch for Integration

Create a branch for your integration work:

```bash
git checkout -b integration/repository-name
```

## Integration Strategy

### 1. Test-Driven Approach

We follow a test-driven approach for integration:

1. Write tests for the components we want to integrate
2. Extract and adapt the necessary code from the forked repository
3. Make the tests pass
4. Refactor as needed
5. Commit only when tests pass

### 2. Component Extraction

When extracting components:

- Maintain the original architecture where possible
- Adapt interfaces to match our project's conventions
- Document any changes from the original implementation
- Keep attribution to the original authors

### 3. Dependency Management

When integrating external code:

- Identify and resolve dependency conflicts
- Update our project's package.json as needed
- Document any third-party dependencies introduced

### 4. Documentation

Document the integration process:

- Update the README.md with information about the integrated components
- Add appropriate comments in the code
- Create or update API documentation

## Example: ollama-mcp-bridge Integration

### Components to Extract

From the ollama-mcp-bridge repository, we plan to extract:

1. **MCP Client (`mcp-client.ts`)**
   - JSON-RPC communication with MCP servers
   - Tool discovery and registration
   - Function calling with parameter validation

2. **Tool Registry (`tool-registry.ts`)**
   - Dynamic tool registration and discovery
   - Keyword-based tool detection from prompts
   - Format instructions generation

3. **Bridge Architecture (`bridge.ts`)**
   - Tool call handling and routing
   - Response processing and formatting
   - Loop detection and prevention

### Integration Steps

1. Create test files for each component:
   - `src/test/suite/mcp/mcpClient.test.ts`
   - `src/test/suite/mcp/mcpToolRegistry.test.ts`
   - `src/test/suite/mcp/llmClient.test.ts`
   - `src/test/suite/mcp/mcpBridgeIntegration.test.ts`

2. Define type definitions:
   - `src/mcp/mcpBridgeTypes.ts`

3. Implement each component:
   - `src/mcp/mcpClient.ts`
   - `src/mcp/mcpToolRegistry.ts`
   - `src/mcp/llmClient.ts`
   - `src/mcp/mcpBridge.ts`

4. Integrate with our VS Code extension:
   - Add commands for interacting with the bridge
   - Add configuration options for MCP servers and LLM providers
   - Implement UI components for visualizing tool usage and results

### Adaptation for VS Code Extension

When adapting for our VS Code extension:

1. Replace console logging with VS Code output channels
2. Use VS Code's configuration API for settings
3. Integrate with VS Code's command system
4. Add appropriate error handling for the VS Code context

## Keeping in Sync with Upstream

To keep our fork in sync with the original repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

Then rebase or merge the changes into our integration branch as needed.

## Legal Considerations

- Respect the original repository's license
- Maintain attribution to the original authors
- Document any substantial changes from the original implementation
- If the original repository has a different license than our project, consult with legal counsel before integration
