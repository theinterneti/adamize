# Ollama-MCP-Bridge Integration Research

## Overview

The [ollama-mcp-bridge](https://github.com/patruff/ollama-mcp-bridge) repository provides a bridge between Ollama (local LLM provider) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This document outlines our research findings and integration plan for incorporating this technology into the Adamize VS Code extension.

## Repository Analysis

### Purpose and Functionality
- Connects Ollama-powered local LLMs to MCP servers
- Enables local models to use the same tools and capabilities as Claude
- Supports multiple MCP servers for various functionalities
- Translates between LLM outputs and MCP's JSON-RPC protocol

### Architecture
- **Bridge**: Core component that manages tool registration and execution
- **LLM Client**: Handles Ollama interactions and formats tool calls
- **MCP Client**: Manages MCP server connections and JSON-RPC communication
- **Tool Registry**: Routes requests to appropriate MCP based on tool type

### Key Features
- Multi-MCP support with dynamic tool routing
- Structured output validation for tool calls
- Automatic tool detection from user prompts
- Robust process management for Ollama
- Detailed logging and error handling

### Technical Implementation
- Written in TypeScript
- Uses child processes to spawn and communicate with MCP servers
- Implements JSON-RPC protocol for MCP communication
- Handles tool discovery, registration, and execution
- Manages tool call iterations and prevents infinite loops

## Integration Plan

### Why Fork and Integrate
1. Provides a solid foundation for local LLM integration with MCP
2. Well-structured code that follows good practices
3. Already implements core functionality we need
4. Can be extended to fit our VS Code extension requirements

### Integration Steps
1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork the repository to our GitHub account and clone it locally
2. **Extract Core Components**: 
   - The MCP client implementation (`mcp-client.ts`)
   - The tool registry system (`tool-registry.ts`)
   - The bridge architecture (`bridge.ts`)

3. **Adapt for VS Code Extension**:
   - Modify the MCP client to work within VS Code's extension context
   - Integrate with our existing MCP client implementation
   - Add VS Code-specific UI components for configuration and interaction

4. **Extend for Memory Graph**:
   - Add memory graph operations as MCP tools
   - Implement persistence for memory graph data
   - Create specialized prompts for memory maintenance

5. **Add Support for Multiple LLM Providers**:
   - Extend the LLM client to support Hugging Face models
   - Add support for llama.cpp through appropriate APIs
   - Create a provider-agnostic interface for LLM interactions

6. **Implement VS Code Integration**:
   - Create commands for interacting with the bridge
   - Add configuration options for MCP servers and LLM providers
   - Implement UI components for visualizing tool usage and results

## Specific Components to Leverage

### MCP Client (`mcp-client.ts`)
- JSON-RPC communication with MCP servers
- Tool discovery and registration
- Function calling with parameter validation

### Tool Registry (`tool-registry.ts`)
- Dynamic tool registration and discovery
- Keyword-based tool detection from prompts
- Format instructions generation

### Bridge Architecture (`bridge.ts`)
- Tool call handling and routing
- Response processing and formatting
- Loop detection and prevention

## Test Plan

Before implementation, we will create tests for the integration following our TDD approach:

1. **MCP Client Integration Tests**:
   - Test connection to MCP servers
   - Test tool discovery and registration
   - Test function calling and parameter validation

2. **Tool Registry Tests**:
   - Test tool registration and discovery
   - Test keyword-based tool detection
   - Test format instructions generation

3. **Bridge Integration Tests**:
   - Test tool call handling and routing
   - Test response processing and formatting
   - Test loop detection and prevention

4. **VS Code Integration Tests**:
   - Test commands for interacting with the bridge
   - Test configuration options for MCP servers and LLM providers
   - Test UI components for visualizing tool usage and results

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Fork repository, create tests, and extract core components
2. **Week 2**: Adapt for VS Code extension and integrate with existing MCP client
3. **Week 3**: Extend for memory graph operations and add support for multiple LLM providers
4. **Week 4**: Implement VS Code integration and finalize documentation

## Conclusion

The ollama-mcp-bridge repository provides an excellent starting point for our goal of using local LLMs for memory graph maintenance in our VS Code extension. By leveraging this existing implementation, we can save significant development time and focus on extending it to meet our specific requirements.
