# Notion Integration

## Overview

The Notion integration allows you to interact with Notion pages and databases directly from VS Code. This integration is designed to help developers maintain documentation, project plans, and knowledge bases alongside their code.

## Features (Coming Soon)

- **Search Notion Pages**: Search for pages in your Notion workspace
- **Create Pages**: Create new pages in Notion
- **Add Content**: Add content to existing pages
- **Add Code Snippets**: Add code snippets from your editor to Notion pages
- **Database Support**: Interact with Notion databases
- **MCP Tool Integration**: Use Notion through the MCP bridge for AI-assisted operations

## Requirements

- Notion API token
- VS Code 1.99.0 or higher
- Adamize extension

## Configuration

The Notion integration can be configured through VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "adamize.notion.enabled": true,
  "adamize.notion.token": "your-notion-api-token",
  "adamize.notion.defaultDatabaseId": "optional-default-database-id"
}
```

The following commands will be available:

- **Notion: Configure Token**: Configure your Notion API token

- **Notion: Add to Page**: Add content to an existing page
- **Notion: Add Code to Page**: Add code from your editor to a Notion page

## MCP Tool Integration

The Notion integration will be available as an MCP tool, allowing AI assistants to interact with Notion. This enables scenarios such as:

- Generating documentation from code
- Creating project plans based on requirements
- Maintaining knowledge bases with AI assistance
- Linking code and documentation

## Implementation Status

The Notion integration is currently under development and will be available in a future release. The implementation will include:

1. **Core Client**: A TypeScript client for the Notion API
2. **VS Code Commands**: Commands for interacting with Notion
3. **MCP Tool**: Integration with the MCP bridge
4. **UI Components**: Webview for browsing and editing Notion pages

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Basic integration with Notion API (search, create, add content)
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced content support (rich text, images, tables)
3. **Phase 3**: Database operations (create, query, update)
4. **Phase 4**: Bidirectional sync between VS Code and Notion
5. **Phase 5**: AI-assisted documentation generation
