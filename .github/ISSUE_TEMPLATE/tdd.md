# Test-Based Development Loop

## Requirement

<!-- Describe the specific, small requirement to implement -->

## Test Description

<!-- Describe the test(s) that will validate this requirement -->

- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

## Implementation Plan

<!-- Briefly describe how you plan to implement this requirement -->

## Refactoring Opportunities

<!-- Identify potential refactoring opportunities after implementation -->

- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

## Completion Condition

<!-- When can you consider this TDD cycle complete? -->

- [ ] Have identified the single, smallest requirement to implement next
- [ ] Have written a test that clearly defines the requirement's behavior
- [ ] The test written now passes
- [ ] Code is cleaned up, and all tests still pass

## Loop Condition

<!-- Under what conditions should you revisit this TDD cycle? -->

- [ ] Cannot identify a small, testable piece of functionality
- [ ] Test does not fail, or test does not accurately reflect the desired requirement
- [ ] Test still fails, or the code written is overly complex for the requirement
- [ ] Refactoring breaks the test, or the code is still messy
